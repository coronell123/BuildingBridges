# Building Bridges Authentication System and User Roles

## Overview
The Building Bridges website needs an improved authentication system with user role management. The system should support three distinct user roles (Admin, Student, and Mentor), implement a more robust sign-up and sign-in process, and provide role-specific dashboard experiences.

## Core Requirements

### User Roles
- Implement three distinct user roles: ADMIN, STUDENT, and MENTOR
- Store user role information in the database
- Include role information in authentication sessions
- Set STUDENT as the default role for new sign-ups

### Authentication Improvements
- Enhance the sign-up form to include role selection
- Ensure proper validation for all form fields
- Improve error handling throughout the authentication process
- Make the authentication flow visually appealing and user-friendly

### Database Updates
- Modify the database schema to include proper role enumeration
- Create a safe migration path for existing users
- Ensure data integrity during schema changes
- Optimize role-based database queries

### Role-Based Dashboards
- Implement conditional rendering based on user role
- Create basic role-specific dashboard views
- Admin dashboard should include user management capabilities
- Mentor dashboard should focus on mentorship activities
- Student dashboard should emphasize learning and workshop access

### Access Control
- Implement middleware-based access control for protected routes
- Restrict certain routes based on user roles
- Provide clear feedback for unauthorized access attempts
- Ensure security is implemented on both client and server sides

## Technical Constraints
- Use the existing Next.js and Drizzle ORM setup
- Maintain compatibility with current database structure
- Follow existing design patterns and component styles
- Keep changes minimal while achieving requirements
- Focus on simple, reliable implementations

## Success Criteria
- Users can sign up and select their role
- Authentication stores and utilizes role information
- Dashboard experience changes based on user role
- Protected routes enforce proper access control
- Solution is robust, maintainable, and user-friendly
