# Navbar Component Guide

The main navigation bar for the application is defined in `components/layout/navbar.tsx`.

## Features

*   **Responsive**: It provides both a desktop and a mobile-friendly navigation menu. The mobile menu is a collapsible drawer.
*   **Dynamic Content**: The links and buttons displayed in the navbar change based on whether the user is authenticated.
    *   **Authenticated users** see a dashboard link with a dropdown for account settings and logout.
    *   **Unauthenticated users** see "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons.
*   **Animation**: The component uses [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for smooth animations on the mobile menu and other elements.
*   **Scroll Effects**: The navbar's background and shadow change dynamically as the user scrolls the page.

## Structure

*   **`navItems`**: An array of objects defining the main navigation links.
*   **`useUser()` hook**: This hook from `lib/auth/index` is used to get the current user's authentication state.
*   **Dropdown Menu**: A dropdown from `components/ui/dropdown-menu` is used for the user account menu.

## Customization

To add or remove navigation links, modify the `navItems` array within `components/layout/navbar.tsx`. To change the behavior for authenticated or unauthenticated users, locate the conditional rendering logic that checks the `user` object.
